      <h1>Priority Objective 16: Fusion Centers</h1>
      <p><strong>Achieve the four Critical Operational Capabilities, four Enabling Capabilities, and other prioritized objectives across the National Network of Fusion Centers to enable effective and lawful execution of their role as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information.</strong></p>
     <br/>
     
      <h3>Steward</h3>
      <p>Responsible Information Sharing Sub Committee (RIS SC) of the ISA IPC</p>
      
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>Timely and well integrated operational information sharing between the Federal Government and the National Network of Fusion Centers (National Network) has not been fully embraced by all Federal partners, which limits state and local information environments’ ability to receive, analyze, and disseminate threat-related information.</p>
      
      <h3>Desired Outcome</h3>
      <p>A fully integrated and sustainable National Network, in which each fusion center has achieved the four Critical Operational Capabilities (COC), four Enabling Capabilities (EC), and other prioritized objectives essential to executing the fusion of information.</p>
      
      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>The RIS SC will ensure that the fusion center assessment process evaluates the maturity of the National Network against the COCs and ECs. Based on assessment findings, the RIS SC will coordinate continued implementation of the Federal Resource Allocation Criteria (RAC) policy to optimize Federal support to fusion centers and coordinate provisioning of training, products, and other resources to increase analytic competencies and collaboration. The RIS SC will continue to strategize mechanisms to sustain capabilities and maintain operational relevance to include monitoring and tracking Federal partners’ provisioning of services and resources to fusion centers and compliance with the Federal RAC policy.</p>
