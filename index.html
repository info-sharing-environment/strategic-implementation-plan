      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Today’s dynamic operating environment challenges Federal, state, local, tribal, and private sector partners to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes and capabilities. While innovation has enhanced the ability to share and we have overcome many cultural barriers, increased sharing has created the potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices. </p>

	<p class="muted">“Our national security depends on sharing the right information with the right people at the right time. We will therefore keep working to maintain an environment in which information is shared in a manner that is responsible, seamless, and secure.”</p>
	<p class="muted">President Barack Obama</p>
	<p class="muted">National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding,<br>
		December 2012</p>
	</div>
     <p>In December 2012 the President signed the National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (Strategy) which is anchored on the 2010 National Security Strategy and builds upon the 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing. The Strategy provides guidance for more effective integration and implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible national security information sharing. This document provides a higher-level overview of a longer, more detailed implementation plan for the Strategy, and is intended to assist in briefing senior policy makers on plans, progress, and performance related to achieving the vision of the NSISS. </p>
     	<p>Under the collaborative leadership of the National Security Staff (NSS) and the Program Manager-Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE), with departments and agencies participating through the Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee (ISA IPC), a government-wide effort is underway to plan and coordinate continued, agency-based implementation of the Strategy’s 16 Priority Objectives.  The ISA IPC, in coordination with the Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee, Federal CIO Council, and other interagency oversight and governance bodies, will transparently monitor progress against milestones and achievement of outcomes described in this Strategic Implementation Plan.</p>
