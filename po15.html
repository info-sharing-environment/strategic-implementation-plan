      <h1>Priority Objective 15: Nationwide SAR Initiative</h1>
      <p><strong>Complete the implementation of the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI) programs in the National Network of Fusion Centers and Federal entities while expanding training and outreach beyond law enforcement to the rest of the public safety community.</strong></p>
     <br/>
     
      <h3>Steward</h3>
      <p>Responsible Information Sharing Sub Committee (RIS SC) of the ISA IPC</p>
      
      <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
      <p>The NSI program is transitioning from its development, deployment, and initial operating capability to long-term operations and sustainment, with program management responsibility transitioning to FBI and DHS. The NSI system and its capabilities must remain operational during this transition with no degradations. Additionally, NSI training and outreach must continue uninterrupted.</p>
      
      <h3>Desired Outcome</h3>
      <p>Seamless transition with no system interruptions or capability degradations while maintaining required levels of operator proficiency and readiness. Ensure the program matures to provide technology enhancements that meet user requirements, while ensuring all training and outreach services are continually updated to reflect the most current threat environment.</p>
      
      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>Leverage lessons learned and best practices to ensure successful transition from NSI Program Management Office. In order to achieve these outcomes, Federal partners must continue to work with local jurisdictions to help improve quality and the quantity of shared information and the analysis performed at all levels of government.</p>
